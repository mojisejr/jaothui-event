# Security Validation Checklist

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose: Ensure Security Compliance in All Changes

### Pre-Implementation Security Check

#### Environment Variables
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in code
- [ ] All sensitive data uses environment variables
- [ ] `.env` file exists and is not committed
- [ ] Production secrets are not in development

#### Input Validation Planning
- [ ] Form inputs will have validation
- [ ] API endpoints will use Zod schemas
- [ ] File upload restrictions planned
- [ ] SQL injection prevention considered

#### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] User authentication flow considered
- [ ] Role-based access control planned
- [ ] Protected routes identified
- [ ] Session management considered

### Pre-Deployment Security Validation

#### API Security
- [ ] Rate limiting configured for sensitive endpoints
- [ ] Input validation implemented for all user inputs
- [ ] Error responses don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] CORS settings appropriate for production

#### File Upload Security
- [ ] File type restrictions implemented
- [ ] File size limits enforced
- [ ] Upload location is secure
- [ ] Malicious file scanning considered

#### Database Security
- [ ] Parameterized queries used (Prisma handles this)
- [ ] No raw SQL with user input
- [ ] Database access permissions appropriate
- [ ] Connection string uses secure authentication

#### Frontend Security
- [ ] No sensitive data in client-side code
- [ ] API keys not exposed in browser
- [ ] Form sanitization implemented
- [ ] XSS prevention considered

### Sensitive Data Handling

#### Never Commit These:
- [ ] API keys or secrets
- [ ] Database credentials
- [ ] User personal information
- [ ] Passwords or authentication tokens
- [ ] Private certificates

#### Secure Patterns:
- [ ] Use environment variables for secrets
- [ ] Implement proper data encryption
- [ ] Follow GDPR compliance for user data
- [ ] Use secure file storage (S3 with proper permissions)

### Build & Deployment Security

#### Production Build Validation
- [ ] No development tools in production build
- [ ] Source maps don't expose sensitive data
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] Error logging doesn't leak information

#### Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All security patches applied
- [ ] Dependencies scanned for vulnerabilities
- [ ] SSL certificates valid and configured
- [ ] Firewall rules appropriate
- [ ] Backup and recovery plan in place

### Common Security Issues to Avoid

#### Authentication Issues
- Weak password policies
- No account lockout after failed attempts
- Session tokens without expiration
- Missing HTTPS enforcement

#### Data Exposure
- Sensitive data in logs
- Error messages revealing system information
- API responses exposing internal structure
- Debug information in production

#### Injection Vulnerabilities
- SQL injection (prevented by Prisma)
- XSS attacks (prevent with input sanitization)
- Command injection
- LDAP injection

### Quick Security Validation Commands

#### Check for Sensitive Data in Commits
```bash
# Search for potential secrets in recent commits
git log --oneline -10 --grep="password\|secret\|key\|token"
git log --patch -5 | grep -i "password\|secret\|key\|api.*key"
```

#### Validate Environment Variables
```bash
# Check if .env exists and is not tracked
ls -la .env
git status | grep .env  # Should show nothing
```

#### Check Dependencies for Vulnerabilities
```bash
npm audit  # or yarn audit
# Fix any high/critical vulnerabilities
```

### Security Response Plan

#### If Security Issue Detected:
1. **Immediate**: Stop deployment
2. **Assess**: Determine impact and scope
3. **Communicate**: Alert relevant team members
4. **Fix**: Implement security patch
5. **Test**: Validate fix doesn't break functionality
6. **Deploy**: Apply security patch
7. **Monitor**: Watch for related issues

### Reporting Security Issues

#### Internal Reporting:
- Document security findings in GitHub issues (private)
- Assign appropriate severity level
- Create fix timeline based on risk assessment
- Track resolution and validation

#### External Security Issues:
- Have clear process for vulnerability disclosure
- Security contact information available
- Response timeline established
- Compensation policy for security researchers
