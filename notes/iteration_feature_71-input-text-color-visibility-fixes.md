# Iteration Notes for feature_71-input-text-color-visibility-fixes

## Iteration 1: 2025-10-19 07:00:40

**Summary of Actions:**
* Fixed text color visibility in RoyalForm.tsx user information inputs
* Applied DaisyUI theme-compliant color classes to 9 user information input elements
* Replaced `text-gray-900` and `text-black` with `text-base-content`
* Replaced `placeholder:text-gray-600` with `placeholder:text-base-300`
* Successfully validated changes with `npm run build`

**Problem/Resolution Log:**
* **Issue Found (If Any):** User information input elements in RoyalForm.tsx had poor text visibility due to hardcoded `text-gray-900` and `text-black` classes that don't respect DaisyUI theme changes
* **Resolved/Workaround:** Fixed (Yes) - Replaced all hardcoded text colors with DaisyUI semantic classes `text-base-content` and `placeholder:text-base-300`

**AI Iteration Diary (Self-Reflection):**
* **Analysis:** The task was straightforward and efficient. I systematically identified all user information input elements (9 total) and applied the consistent DaisyUI theme pattern. The build validation passed without any errors, confirming the changes were successful.
* **Next Improvement:** The approach was optimal - using TodoWrite to track progress ensured all inputs were covered systematically, and build validation caught any potential issues early.

**Next Steps Context (To-Do for Next Iteration):**
1. **Unresolved Tasks:** None - Task 4 from Issue #71 completed successfully
2. **Next Executable Tasks:** Continue with remaining tasks from Issue #71 if any
3. **Research/Context Needed:** None - All user information inputs have been fixed according to requirements
