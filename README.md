# Jaothui Event Registration System

## Overview
This is the event registration system for Thai buffalo (Kwai Plak Thai) competitions.

## Registration Features

### Automated LINE Notification System
Upon successful registration, applicants receive an automated confirmation message via LINE with the following details:
- **Cow's Name** (‡∏ä‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠‡∏Ñ‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏¢)
- **Chip Number** (‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏Ç‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏à‡∏≥‡∏ï‡∏±‡∏ß‡∏™‡∏±‡∏ï‡∏ß‡πå)
- **Sex** (‡πÄ‡∏û‡∏®)
- **Color** (‡∏™‡∏µ)
- **Registered Class/Category** (‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏†‡∏ó‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà‡∏•‡∏á‡∏™‡∏°‡∏±‡∏Ñ‡∏£)

This system uses the LINE messaging API to send instant confirmation to registrants, similar to the implementation used in the Pak Chong event.

### Registration Types

#### 1. Regular Event Registration
- Standard registration for provincial and national level competitions
- Automatic LINE notification upon successful registration
- Registration includes all buffalo details and owner information

#### 2. Royal Event Registration
- Special registration flow for royal-level competitions
- Enhanced verification process with image upload requirements
- Includes approval workflow with status tracking
- LINE notifications sent at registration and approval stages

## On-Site Registration Procedure

For events that permit on-site registration, the following process should be followed:

### Process Steps:
1. **Use Standard Registration Link**
   - The team uses the same online registration link/system for all on-site registrations
   - This ensures data consistency and unified processing

2. **Enter Applicant Details**
   - Input all required buffalo and owner information through the standard form
   - Include all mandatory fields: name, microchip, sex, color, class, etc.

3. **Automated Notification**
   - Upon submission, applicants automatically receive a LINE confirmation message
   - The message contains all registration details for verification

4. **Unified Data Retrieval**
   - All registration data (online and on-site) is stored in the same database
   - Data retrieval is performed once at the end of the registration period
   - No separate processing required for on-site vs. online registrations

### Benefits of This Approach:
- **Single Source of Truth**: All data in one unified system
- **Consistent Experience**: Same notification process for all registrants
- **Simplified Management**: One data retrieval process at the end
- **Real-time Confirmation**: Immediate LINE notification for on-site registrants

## Technical Implementation

### LINE Notification Flow
1. Registration data is validated and saved to the database
2. A confirmation message is generated using `messageParser` or `royalMessageParser`
3. The message is sent via LINE API using the `notify` function
4. Message includes all key registration details formatted for easy reading

### Message Format
Messages are formatted in Thai with clear sections and checkmarks (‚úÖ) for easy readability:
